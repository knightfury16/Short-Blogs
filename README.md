# Learning-Node


Learning the basic of node from a youtube series, [``Node.js Crash Course Tutorial.``](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU)

Was not satisfied with the tutorial so I downloaded a course from Udemy and started learning more and going deep.

But learned the basic and got interested in node from this series.

## Things I learned from this series

- Request and Response from http core node module.
- Express App
- View Engine 
- Middleware
- MongoDB
- MVC(Model–view–controller) Model
